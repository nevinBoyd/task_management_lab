# Task Management System

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project is a **Python-based Task Management System** built as part of the Flatiron School Module 6 Lab: _Functions, Libraries, and Input Validation._

The program allows users to:

- Add tasks with a title, description, and due date
- Mark tasks as complete
- View pending tasks
- Track progress as a completion percentage

It reinforces key Python concepts including:

- Functions and modular programming
- Importing and reusing modules
- Data validation using `datetime`
- Lists and dictionaries for data storage

---

## Features

- **Add Task:** Create new tasks with validation for title, description, and due date.
- **Mark Complete:** Update a taskâ€™s status once itâ€™s done.
- **View Pending:** Display all tasks that are not yet completed.
- **Progress Tracker:** Calculate and show overall completion percentage.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- Built-in modules only (`datetime`)
- No external libraries required

## Templates and Structure

This project was built using the provided Flatiron School **Task Management System** templates.  
The following starter files were included and then expanded with custom logic and validation:

- `main.py` â€“ base menu and control flow
- `task_utils.py` â€“ placeholder functions for task logic
- `validation.py` â€“ input validation scaffolding
